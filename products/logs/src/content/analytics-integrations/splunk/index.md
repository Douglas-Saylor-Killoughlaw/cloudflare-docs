# Splunk

This tutorial explains how to analyze [Cloudflare Logs](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-logs/) using the [Cloudflare App for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4501/).

## Overview

If you havenâ€™t used Cloudflare Logs before, visit our [Logs documentation](/) for more details. Contact your Cloudflare Customer Account Team to enable logs for your account.

This tutorial describes how to send HTTP request lots directly to Splunk. 

### Prerequisites

Before sending your Cloudflare log data to Splunk, ensure that you:

- Have an existing Splunk Enterprise or Cloud account
- Have a Cloudflare Enterprise account with Cloudflare Logs enabled
- Configure [Logpush](/logpush/) or [Logpull](/logpull-api/)
- Consult the [Splunk documentation](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4501/) for the Cloudflare App

<Aside type="note" header="Note">

Cloudflare logs are HTTP/HTTPS request logs in JSON format and are gathered from our 200+ data centers globally. By default, timestamps are returned as Unix nanosecond integers. We recommend using the RFC 3339 format for sending logs to Splunk.
</Aside>


## Task 1 - Install and Configure the Cloudflare App for Splunk

To install the [Cloudflare App for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4501/):

1. Log in to your Splunk instance.
2. Under **Apps** > **Find More Apps**, search for _Cloudflare App for Splunk._
3. Click **Install**.

![Splunk find Cloudflare app](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-cloudflare-app-for-splunk.png)
4. Restart and reopen your Splunk instance . 

Once installed, create an index on Splunk to store the HTTP Event logs. To create an index:

1. Open the setup screen by clicking the **Settings** dropdown, then click **Indexes**.
2. Select **New Index**. Note that the **Indexes** page also gives you the status of all your existing indexes so that you can see whether you're about to use up your licensed amount of space.
3. Name the index **cloudflare**, which is the default index that the Cloudflare App will use. 

After you've created an index, set up the HTTP Event Collector (HEC) on Splunk. To create an HEC:

1. Click the **Settings** dropdown and select **Data inputs**. 
2. Click **+Add new** and follow the wizard. When prompted, submit the following responses:
    * Name: Cloudflare
    * Source Type: Select > "_json"
    * App Context: Cloudflare App for Splunk (cloudflare)
    * Index: cloudflare

At the end of the wizard you will see a **Token Value**. This token will authorize the Cloudflare Logpush job to send data to your Splunk instance. If you forget to copy it now, Splunk allows you to get the value at any time. 

The final information you need is the endpoint to use to send the data to. The endpoint should be:

```bash
"<protocol>://input-<host>:<port>/<endpoint>" or "<protocol>://http-inputs-<host>:<port>/<endpoint>"
```
* `protocol`: HTTP or HTTPS
* `input`: `input` or `http-inputs` based on whether you have a self-service or managed cloud plan
* `host`: The hostname of your Splunk instance. The easiest way to determine the hostname is to look at the URL you went to when you logged in to Splunk.
* `port`: 443 or 8088
* `endpoint`: Services/collector/raw

Refer to the [Splunk Documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/8.1.2011/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector) for more details and examples. 

**Post Installation Notes**

You can change the **Index Name** after initial configuration by accessing the app **Set up** page by clicking on the **Apps** dropdown and navigating to **Manage Apps** > **Cloudflare App for Splunk** > **Set up**.

![Splunk apps set up interface](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-apps-manage-apps-cloudflare-set-up.png)

You also can find the Index Name manually by visiting **Settings** > **Advanced search** > **Search macros**.

![Splunk search macros](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-settings-advanced-search-search-macros.png)

The Cloudflare App for Splunk comes with a custom Cloudflare Data Model that has an acceleration time frame of 1 day but is not accelerated by default. If you enable [Data Model acceleration](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.2.6/Knowledge/Acceleratedatamodels), we recommend that the Data Model is only accelerated for 1 or 7 days to ensure there are no adverse effects within your Splunk environment.

You can enable or disable acceleration after the initial configuration by accessing the app Set up page by clicking the **Apps** dropdown, then **Manage Apps** > **Cloudflare Set Up**.

![Splunk search macros](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-apps-manage-apps-cloudflare-set-up-enable-data-model-acceleration.png)

You can also manually configure Data Models by going to **Settings** > **Data models**. Learn more about data model acceleration in the [Splunk documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Knowledge/Acceleratedatamodels).

## Task 2 - Make the API call to create the Logpush job

The Logpush API call should look like the following: 

```bash
"Email="<Your Email Address Associated with your Global Key>"
GlobalKey="<Your Global Key>"
ZoneID="<Your ZoneID>"
Hostname="<The Hostname Of Your Splunk Instance>"
HEC_Token="<The Token presented after creating the HEC>"
SelfSingedCert="true"
Port=8088
# Create a Channel ID. It just needs to be a unique string. It is recommended to use an UUID. The uuidgen program on Linux creates a UUID.
Channel=$(uuidgen)
curl -s -X POST -H "X-Auth-Email: $Email" -H "X-Auth-Key: $GlobalKey" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZoneID/logpush/jobs -d "{\"name\":\"Splunk\",\"destination_conf\":\"Splunk://${Hostname}:${Port}/services/collector/raw?channel=${Channel}&insecure-skip-verify=${SelfSignedCert}&sourcetype=_json&header_Authorization=Splunk%20${HEC_Token}\",\"logpull_options\":\"fields=RayID&timestamps=rfc3339\",\"dataset\": \"http_requests\"}"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "errors": [],
  "messages": [],
  "result": {
    "id": 21752,
    "dataset": "http_requests",
    "logstream": true,
    "enabled": false,
    "name": "Splunk",
    "logpull_options": "fields=RayID&timestamps=rfc3339",
    "destination_conf": "Splunk://prd-p-0qk3h.splunkcloud.com:8088/services/collector/raw?channel=b7de05a8-7324-4cb3-ac21-8118f5bca4a2&insecure-skip-verify=true&sourcetype=_json&header_Authorization=Splunk%208aabd820-e44a-4352-9765-5bc395d8b915",
    "last_complete": null,
    "last_error": null,
    "error_message": null
  },
  "success": true
}
```

This API call creates a Logpush job but does not enable it. You will need to enable the Logpush job after setting the desired fields to push. The final step to start pushing data into Splunk is to:
1. Navigate to the Cloudflare dashboard and select **Analytics** > **Logs**. 
2. Click **Edit** and select the fields referenced in the Dashboard section below to fully populate all tables and graphs. 
3. Enable the Logpush job by toggling on the switch next to the Edit link. Data takes a few minutes to populate. 

To validate that you are receiving data, search `index=cloudflare` in Splunk.  

## Task 3 - View the Dashboards

You can analyze Cloudflare logs with the thirteen (13) dashboards listed below.

You can use filters within these dashboards to help narrow the analysis by date and time, device type, country, user agent, client IP, hostname, and more to further help with debugging and tracing.

### About the Dashboards

![Splunk dashboard Cloudflare Performance Static vs. Dynamic Content](../../static/images/splunk/dashboards/splunk-cloudflare-performance-static-vs-dynamic-dashboard.png)

### Filters

All dashboard have a set of filters that you can apply to the entire dashboard, as shown in the following example. Filters are applied across the entire dashboard.

![Splunk Cloudflare filters](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-filters.png)

You can use filters to drill down and examine the data at a granular level. Filters include client country, client device type, client IP, client request host, client request URI, client request user agent, edge response status, origin IP, and origin response status.

The default time interval is set to 24 hours. Note that for correct calculations filter will need to exclude Worker subrequests (**WorkerSubrequest** = _false_) and purge requests (**ClientRequestMethod** is not _PURGE_).

Available Filters:

- Time Range (EdgeStartTimestamp)

- Client Country

- Client Device type

- Client IP

- Client Request Host

- Client Request URI

- Client Request User Agent

- Edge response status

- Origin IP

- Origin Response Status

- RayID

- Worker Subrequest

- Client Request Method

## Debugging tips

### Incomplete dashboards

The Splunk Cloudflare App relies on data from the Cloudflare Enterprise Logs fields outlined below. Depending on which fields you have enabled, certain dashboards might not populate fully.

If that is the case, verify and test the Cloudflare App filters below each dashboard (these filters are the same across all dashboards). You can delete any filters that you donâ€™t need, even if such filters include data fields already contained in your logs.

Also, you could compare the list of fields you are getting in Cloudflare Logs with the fields listed in **Splunk** > **Settings** > **Data Model** > **Cloudflare**.

The available fields are:

- CacheCacheStatus

- CacheResponseBytes

- CacheResponseStatus

- ClientASN

- ClientCountry

- ClientDeviceType

- ClientIP

- ClientIPClass

- ClientRequestBytes

- ClientRequestHost

- ClientRequestMethod
